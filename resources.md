### 1. [Ugarit Translation Aligner](http://ugarit.ialigner.com)  

![Ugarit](/images/ugarit.png)

**What:** The Ugarit Translation Aligner allows a user to manually match words in one language with their corresponding translations in another. It also includes a translation vocabulary test generated by the users' alignments.  
**Uses:** Ugarit helps you visualize a translator's fidelity to or license with the source text, so it can support analyses of reception. It can also form a classroom assignment that simultaneously tests students' understanding of grammar in the source language and reading comprehension in the target language.  

### 2. [Classical Language Toolkit](http://cltk.org)

![CLTK](/images/cltk.png)

**What:** CLTK is a collection of coding tools for the analysis of ancient texts and the study of many ancient languages, including Latin and Greek, the tools for which are mostly written in Python. Some coding knowledge is necessary. Tools for Latin and Greek include a macronizer (to place macrons above long vowels in diacritic-less Latin), lemmatizers (to return the dictionary headwords of every word in a given text), tokenizers (to divide a text into words, lines, or sentences), and accentuation and diacritic generators and removers in Greek.  
**Uses:** The sky's the limit. CLTK includes tools that can be applied both in pedagogic and research contexts. For example, in a classroom setting, the macronizer can help you generate a paragraph of Latin for first-semester students on a homework assignment or exam, and the lemmatizers can help you create vocabulary lists for difficult passages. In scholarship, the tokenizers allow you to perform word searches or concurrences of words across large corpora through n-grams. CLTK also invites collaborators to contribute to the project in whatever way they can, in terms of writing or editing code, notifying the team about bugs or issues, etc.

### 1. [Bridge](http://bridge.haverford.edu)

![Bridge](/images/bridge.png)

**What**: The Bridge generates vocabulary lists for a given Latin or Greek text or textbook with many customization features. You can base the list on a specific passage or textbook chapter, exclude terms that appear in other parts of the work/textbook or other works entirely, include statistics for the frequency of the term in the work under consideration, limit a list to certain parts of speech, link out to the full dictionary entry in Logeion, and so on!  
**Uses**: The Bridge aims at building a student or reader's vocabulary knowledge by providing a *bridge* from what the student/reader doesn't know to what the student/reader does. I (Daniel) have personally used Bridge to generate vocabulary lists for Intermediate Greek students reading Homer for the first time, and it has been very useful to have a discrete set of vocabulary items for each assignment. The Bridge is constantly adding new texts and textbooks for use from the first semester of a language into advanced seminars; the recent addition of Seneca's *de Ira* and *de Constantia* just pushed the Latin corpus past 500,000 words.

(((( "these are the things that we have found personally useful for our own scholarship and pedagogy, but there are many other things out there; not a be-all and end-all, these are good things for entry-level, basic needs in Classics/archaeology" ))))
(((( screenshot, sentence blurb, and why it's useful ))))
(((( eventually, thematic posts that highlight other projects with links to the main page ))))
(((( broad sense of what's out there -- list is not exhaustive; links to similar projects (e.g. Perseus, Logeion, Alpheios) ))))
(((( Homer Multitext, LACE, Logeion, Alpheios ))))
