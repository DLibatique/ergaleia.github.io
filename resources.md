This is a listing of digital tools that we have found personally useful in our own research and pedagogy. There are *many* other digital tools out there for Classicists and archaeologists; this list is by no means exhaustive or comprehensive. Our goal is to provide a short annotated list of basic tools that fulfill basic needs in Classical scholarship or teaching. Other resources will be added as time goes on, some accompanied by a longer explanatory post on the *ergaleia* blog.

### 1. [Ugarit Translation Aligner](http://ugarit.ialigner.com)  

![Ugarit](/images/ugarit.png)

**What:** The Ugarit Translation Aligner allows a user to manually match words in one language with their corresponding translations in another. It also includes a translation vocabulary test generated by the users' alignments.  

**Uses:** Ugarit helps you visualize a translator's fidelity to or license with the source text, so it can support analyses of reception. It can also form a classroom assignment that simultaneously tests students' understanding of grammar in the source language and reading comprehension in the target language.  

### 2. [Classical Language Toolkit](http://cltk.org)

![CLTK](/images/cltk.png)

**What:** CLTK is a collection of coding tools for the analysis of ancient texts and the study of many ancient languages, including Latin and Greek, the tools for which are mostly written in Python. Some coding knowledge is necessary. Tools for Latin and Greek include a macronizer (to place macrons above long vowels in diacritic-less Latin), lemmatizers (to return the dictionary headwords of every word in a given text), tokenizers (to divide a text into words, lines, or sentences), and accentuation and diacritic generators and removers in Greek.  

**Uses:** The sky's the limit. CLTK includes tools that can be applied both in pedagogic and research contexts. For example, in a classroom setting, the macronizer can help you generate a paragraph of Latin for first-semester students on a homework assignment or exam, and the lemmatizers can help you create vocabulary lists for difficult passages. In scholarship, the tokenizers allow you to perform word searches or concurrences of words across large corpora through n-grams. CLTK also invites collaborators to contribute to the project in whatever way they can, in terms of writing or editing code, notifying the team about bugs or issues, etc.

### 3. Quantitative Criticism Lab (Ryan)

### 1. [Bridge](http://bridge.haverford.edu)

![Bridge](/images/bridge.png)

**What**: The Bridge generates vocabulary lists for a given Latin or Greek text or textbook with many customization features. You can base the list on a specific passage or textbook chapter, exclude terms that appear in other parts of the work/textbook or other works entirely, include statistics for the frequency of the term in the work under consideration, limit a list to certain parts of speech, link out to the full dictionary entry in Logeion, and so on!  

**Uses**: The Bridge aims at building a student or reader's vocabulary knowledge by providing a *bridge* from what the student/reader doesn't know to what the student/reader does. I (Daniel) have personally used Bridge to generate vocabulary lists for Intermediate Greek students reading Homer for the first time, and it has been very useful to have a discrete set of vocabulary items for each assignment. The Bridge is constantly adding new texts and textbooks for use from the first semester of a language into advanced seminars; the recent addition of Seneca's *de Ira* and *de Constantia* just pushed the Latin corpus past 500,000 words.

### 2. Hedera (Ryan)
### 3. Scaife Viewer / Perseus 5.0 (coming soon)

![Perseus5](/images/scaife.PNG)

**What:** The Scaife Viewer/Perseus 5.0 offers a substantial upgrade from current iteration of Perseus. The tool will feature a clean, customizable reading environment for ancient texts with facing translations. The user can highlight words or passages of interest in the text and instantly share their annotations or save them for later. As before, words in passages link directly to a lemma and relevant dictionary entries; in addition to parsing forms, the user can now review conjugations and declensions with grammar tables for specific lemmas. The accompanying Vocabulary Tool can create word frequency lists for the entire corpus, specific authors, works, or even sections of works. By making an account, users can track the passages they have read and vocabulary encountered and generate flashcards to reinforce new vocabulary.

**Uses:** Perseus 5.0 has a number of potential pedagogical uses. A few: it is a great reading tool for those without access to texts, and so great for language-learning courses where cost of materials is a concern; the improved frequency list generation can be tailored to, for example, an entire PhD reading list or a seminar’s readings and so help a student prepare for coursework or exams. As a researcher, text highlighting will make marking and retrieving texts a breeze – all you need is a link.  

## <a name="material-culture">Material Culture</a>

### 1. [OpenARCHEM](http://openarchem.org)

![OpenARCHEM](/images/openarchem.png)

**What:** OpenARCHEM is a database (currently being built) for organic objects and compounds involved in archaeometry, the application of scientific techniques from fields like chemistry to inquiries into material culture. Each entry can link out as appropriate to other datasets like Dr. Duke's Phyochemical and Ethnobotanical Databases, Flora of Israel Online, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology's Chemistry WebBook for further, more detailed information on any given substance or material.  

**Uses:** This database will be useful for a different perspective on material culture that can both enrich existing scholarship and open up new areas. There are also opportunities for collaboration and contribution from specialists and non-specialists alike, as each database entry constitutes a publication with a DOI and publication credits indexed in Google Scholar; one can envision fruitful opportunities for, e.g., undergraduates to create an entry for openARCHEM as a term project. More information can be found at the [openARCHEM WordPress site](https://openarchem.wordpress.com).

### 2. WIRE Project (Ryan)

## <a name="mapping-geography">Mapping and Geography</a>

### 1. [ToposText](http://topostext.org)

![ToposText](/images/topostext.png)

**What:** ToposText, a 2016 Digital Humanities Award winner for Best Public Engagement, is a library of ancient texts keyed to a dedicated gazetteer, available via desktop or a mobile app (on iOS or Google). Any given place name includes a modern description of the site; metadata like latitude, longitude, and region; and a list of textual references to the site.  

**Uses:** ToposText helps a scholar or student visualize an ancient site in its larger geographic context. You can search by a specific place name and see its context on a map and the ancient passages that mention it, or you can begin from the level of the text: clicking on a title brings you to the text itself with people and place names hyperlinked to ToposText entries. These features lend themselves to both geographic and textual study; for example, a reference to an importance place like Mycenae can lead a student to looking up all instances in the ToposText textual canon that mention Mycenae, allowing the student to draw connections or pursue a line of connection previously unconsidered.

### 2. Pleiades Project (Ryan)

**BY FEBRUARY 6TH!!!**

(((( "these are the things that we have found personally useful for our own scholarship and pedagogy, but there are many other things out there; not a be-all and end-all, these are good things for entry-level, basic needs in Classics/archaeology" ))))
(((( screenshot, sentence blurb, and why it's useful ))))
(((( eventually, thematic posts that highlight other projects with links to the main page ))))
(((( broad sense of what's out there -- list is not exhaustive; links to similar projects (e.g. Perseus, Logeion, Alpheios) ))))
(((( Homer Multitext, LACE, Logeion, Alpheios ))))
