## Textual Analysis 

### 1. [Ugarit Translation Aligner](http://ugarit.ialigner.com)  

![Ugarit](/images/ugarit.png)

**What:** The Ugarit Translation Aligner allows a user to manually match words in one language with their corresponding translations in another. It also includes a translation vocabulary test generated by the users' alignments.  
**Uses:** Ugarit helps you visualize a translator's fidelity to or license with the source text, so it can support analyses of reception. It can also form a classroom assignment that simultaneously tests students' understanding of grammar in the source language and reading comprehension in the target language.

(((( "these are the things that we have found personally useful for our own scholarship and pedagogy, but there are many other things out there; not a be-all and end-all, these are good things for entry-level, basic needs in Classics/archaeology" ))))
(((( screenshot, sentence blurb, and why it's useful ))))
(((( eventually, thematic posts that highlight other projects with links to the main page ))))
(((( broad sense of what's out there -- list is not exhaustive; links to similar projects (e.g. Perseus, Logeion, Alpheios) ))))
(((( Homer Multitext, LACE, Logeion, Alpheios ))))
