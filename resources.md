### 1. [Ugarit Translation Aligner](http://ugarit.ialigner.com)  

![Ugarit](/images/ugarit.png)

**What:** The Ugarit Translation Aligner allows a user to manually match words in one language with their corresponding translations in another. It also includes a translation vocabulary test generated by the users' alignments.  
**Uses:** Ugarit helps you visualize a translator's fidelity to or license with the source text, so it can support analyses of reception. It can also form a classroom assignment that simultaneously tests students' understanding of grammar in the source language and reading comprehension in the target language.  

### 2. [Classical Language Toolkit](http://cltk.org)

![CLTK](/images/cltk.png)

**What:** CLTK is a collection of coding tools for the analysis of ancient texts and the study of many ancient languages, including Latin and Greek, the tools for which are mostly written in Python. Some coding knowledge is necessary. Tools for Latin and Greek include a macronizer (to place macrons above long vowels in diacritic-less Latin), lemmatizers (to return the dictionary headwords of every word in a given text), tokenizers (to divide a text into words, lines, or sentences), and accentuation and diacritic generators and removers in Greek.  
**Uses:** The sky's the limit. CLTK includes tools that can be applied both in pedagogic and research contexts. For example, in a classroom setting, the macronizer can help you generate a paragraph of Latin for first-semester students on a homework assignment or exam, and the lemmatizers can help you create vocabulary lists for difficult passages. In scholarship, the tokenizers allow you to perform word searches or concurrences of words across large corpora through n-grams. CLTK also invites collaborators to contribute to the project in whatever way they can, in terms of writing or editing code, notifying the team about bugs or issues, etc.

### 3. Scaife Viewer / Perseus 5.0 (coming soon)

![Perseus5](/images/scaife.PNG)

**What:** The Scaife Viewer/Perseus 5.0 offers a substantial upgrade from current iteration of Perseus. The tool will feature a clean, customizable reading environment for ancient texts with facing translations. The user can highlight words or passages of interest in the text and instantly share their annotations or save them for later. As before, words in passages link directly to a lemma and relevant dictionary entries; in addition to parsing forms, the user can now review conjugations and declensions with grammar tables for specific lemmas. The accompanying Vocabulary Tool can create word frequency lists for the entire corpus, specific authors, works, or even sections of works. By making an account, users can track the passages they have read and vocabulary encountered and generate flashcards to reinforce new vocabulary.
**Uses:** Perseus 5.0 has a number of potential pedagogical uses. A few: it is a great reading tool for those without access to texts, and so great for language-learning courses where cost of materials is a concern; the improved frequency list generation can be tailored to, for example, an entire PhD reading list or a seminar’s readings and so help a student prepare for coursework or exams. As a researcher, text highlighting will make marking and retrieving texts a breeze – all you need is a link.

(((( "these are the things that we have found personally useful for our own scholarship and pedagogy, but there are many other things out there; not a be-all and end-all, these are good things for entry-level, basic needs in Classics/archaeology" ))))
(((( screenshot, sentence blurb, and why it's useful ))))
(((( eventually, thematic posts that highlight other projects with links to the main page ))))
(((( broad sense of what's out there -- list is not exhaustive; links to similar projects (e.g. Perseus, Logeion, Alpheios) ))))
